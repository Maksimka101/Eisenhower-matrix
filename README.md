# How to build
To build app you need to:
 - Install flutter.
 - Create firebase project.
 - Enable Google, Apple, Github, Twitter and Anonymous authentication.
 - Enable firestore and setup rules. For now, I allow read and write to every one.
 - Setup your credentials for authentication by following instructions in lib/main. 
 
 Don't forget to enable flutter desktop support using [this guide](https://flutter.dev/desktop) to be able to build desktop apps.
